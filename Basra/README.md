# Basra
## Basra is a cards game and it has simple rules:
- At the beginning of the game each play takes 4 cards and we also put 4 cards on the table.
- Each player plays only one card, the turn lasts until each player has no cards left.
- Then each turn each play takes 4 cards but we don't put cards on the table.
- In each turn, the aim is to collect as many cards from the table as you can.
- You can take cards if it has the same value as your card, or more than one card if its sum equals your card.
- 'Q', 'K', and 'J' are not included in the sum.
- If the card is 'J' or '7c' you take all cards on the table.
- You can achieve a Basra(which worth 10 points) if you take all cards on the table with a normal card, or with '7c' but its sum or sums are equal or less than 10.
- 'J' 's basra worth 30 point.
- if '7c' is on the table you can immediately achieve Basra.
- If no cards are left in the deck the round is over and the one who has more cards earns 30 points.
- To end the game one of the players must reach the foura score.
- Foura score is a score which who reaches first wins.
